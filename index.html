          <p class="p_co_2">I am a passionate woman that loves to express my creativity alongside like-minded
            individuals
            and excel in groups of enthusiastic
            collaborators, as they serve as a source of inspiration and learning for me. I bring with me
            a
            wide range of knowledge,
            as well as a curiosity that motivates me to continually seek more knowledge. What I don't
            know yet, I can learn, and
            what I do know, I can apply.</p>
