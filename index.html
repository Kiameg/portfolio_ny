                Together we made a
                succesful website along with jOUXli's digital marketing stragety. My tasks were mainly the Javascript
                used for the menu

                mainly coding html and css on some of the website.</p>

              <p class="p_swiper">This was my first semester exam. One of the biggest projects I had done at the time. I
                enjoyed designing and coding the site. I went for a futuristic vibe and Roboto font which suited me at
                the time, and I remember being very proud. (Ps. the links to projects on this website does not function

              <p class="p_swiper">Last but not least, this was a small javascript game I created on my first semester.
                This was a fun ride, making everything from scratch such as, the sounds and drawings/backgrounds. I
                would love to try to make it again someday. (This game contains NSFW content)</p>

          <p>My name is Kia, I am twentyeight years old and I study multimedia design. At KEA, i've had the opportunity
            to
            improve my skills in a wide range of
            programs, including Adobe InDesign, Figma and Photoshop. Additionally, I enjoy coding and have
            experience with HTML,

          <p>I've recently started to get familiar with; Vite, React, Tailwind and Sass.</p>
          <p>In addition to spending time with my family and friends, I use my time for
            gaming and creative hobbies such as drawing,
            coding, or playing around with Adobe's programs for small creative tasks. I enjoy watching
            movies, series, and I love to
            travel. Unfortunately, I also have a significant time sink in memes and funny videos, oops!</p>
